# Earthquake-data-analysis

Predicting earthquakes has been one of the most challenging tasks as it occurs arbitrarily and the
economy is affected due to damage of the properties and lives. Detections of the severe earthquakes were
previously very difficult to identify. It has become more advanced and accessible with the advancement of
technology in seismology and data collection. If we are able to predict these earthquakes early it can reduce
the consequences of earthquakes. This research is to analyze the Spatio-temporal relation of earthquakes
in a hierarchical manner to indicate the location of the earthquake, and if there is a possibility of an
earthquake according to the prediction, then its magnitude range and value will be estimated using the
seismic parameters of the particular location using the preprocessing the data at various levels. This
research outcome will help the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to allocate and position their
resources in the right location to assist people in an evacuation, supply, and save lives.

To predict, follow this order: <br/>
Step 1: Go to location_precition/LSTM and run lstm_data_preprocessing.ipynb to format the original data.

Step 2: 

Step 3: For the regions, which have ones, run their specific region files in magnitude_prediction/magnitude_classification for classification. <br/>
        AND <br/>
        for estimation go to magnitude_prediction/magnitude_estimation
